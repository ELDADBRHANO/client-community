# Communities.

This project was created by me and by my partners to the hackathon.
the issue we with given is the problem and complexities on mangaing a community.


 the project answers to difficulties that an community admin runs into his daily work.
 
 The main idea that we thought about is handeling the data for the admin on the best way we can, so we built an app that gathers all the communities in one place and    the admins can check out their dashborad inside the platform to see traffic, numbers of users, new users and more.
