# Community Management App

This project was created as part of a hackathon by a team of developers to address the challenges and complexities of managing a community. The aim of the project is to simplify the data management for community administrators, allowing them to handle their daily tasks more efficiently.

## Problem

Managing a community can be a difficult task, especially when it comes to handling data. Administrators may find it hard to keep track of traffic, numbers of users, new users and other important metrics. This can lead to inefficiencies and a lack of progress for the community.

## Solution
The main idea behind the Community Management App is to provide a centralized platform where community administrators can manage their data in the most effective way possible. The app gathers all communities in one place and provides administrators with a dashboard to see traffic, numbers of users, new users and more. This allows them to make informed decisions and take actions based on the data provided.
